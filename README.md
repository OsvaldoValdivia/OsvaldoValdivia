Welcome to my Portofolio. My name is Osvaldo and I am happy to see you here !

In this repository, you will find some personal projects I've done to demonstrate some of my skills such as :
  - Data gathering
  - Data exploration
  - Statistical analysis
  - Data visualization
  - Presentation skills
  - And more ...

Projects shown here have been done using Python programming language in Jupyter Notebooks and Power BI.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder.

## About Me
I am currently working as an Architectural and Performance Consultant for IS. My primary job is to analyze and create test scripts that replicates actual user behavior
for different IS. Once done, I used this scripts to study the behavior of the applications while applying charge and finally I analyze the most important metrics obtained, such as: response time, 
CPU and Memory Load of the servers, errors type and rate, etc. Finally I work with different teams to report the most important insights of the obtained data not only to share the results 
but also to find potential improvements or errors solutions.

## My Data Journey
My Data Journey began in my last year at University of Technology of Compi√®gne (France), where I receive my Software Ingenier degree. 
I became mesmerized with data after learning how raw data was utilized in different industries such as marketing, healthcare and finance, not only to explain actual behaviors, but also to predict
them and exploiting it for decisions making.

In In my last semester at University I had the opportunity to work in a challenging Data Science project which objective was to explain the reasons why automobile customers are loyal to a brand as
well as the reasons why they leave their current brands. The obtained results served as the basis for marketing campaign creation.

Since then, for me each dataset is an uncharted galaxy, waiting to be decoded so that it can contribute to the greater tapestry of knowledge.

# Projects
## Project 1 - World Happiness Score

This project analyzes happiness scores from the Gallup World Poll (2015-2019) using the Cantril ladder scale (0-10). It visualizes and explores factors contributing to happiness across countries, including economic production, region, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity through interactive visualizations. The aim is to understand global happiness patterns during this period.

## Project 2 - Medical Appointment Analysis

This project aims to understand why patients miss their medical appointments. Analyzing a dataset of over 110,000 appointments with 14 variables, the goal is to identify factors contributing to these no-shows. By using data analysis and predictive models, the project aims to help healthcare professionals reduce no-show rates by understanding patient behaviors and improving appointment scheduling.

## Project 3 - Students summary

Competition project

## Project 4 - Job Satisfaction

This project analyzes job satisfaction factors in European countries using 2018 Eurostat data. It investigates how metrics like working hours, income, remote work, and weekend work affect job satisfaction. Through Python and various visualizations like barplots, scatter plots, maps, and regression decision trees, it aims to reveal insights into job satisfaction dynamics across Europe.
