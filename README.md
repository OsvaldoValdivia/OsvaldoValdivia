# Osvaldo VALDIVIA

Welcome to my Portofolio. My name is Osvaldo and I am happy to see you here !

In this repository, you will find some personal projects I've done to demonstrate some of my skills such as :
  - Data gathering
  - Data exploration
  - Statistical analysis
  - Data visualization
  - Presentation skills
  - And more ...

Projects shown here have been done using Python programming language in Jupyter Notebooks and Power BI.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder.

## About Me
I am currently working as an Architectural and Performance Consultant for IS. My primary job is to analyze and create test scripts that replicates actual user behavior
for different IS. Once done, I used this scripts to study the behavior of the applications while applying charge and finally I analyze the most important metrics obtained, such as: response time, 
CPU and Memory Load of the servers, errors type and rate, etc. Finally I work with different teams to report the most important insights of the obtained data not only to share the results 
but also to find potential improvements or errors solutions.

## My Data Journey
My Data Journey began in my last year at University of Technology of Compi√®gne (France), where I receive my Software Ingenier degree. 
I became mesmerized with data after learning how raw data was utilized in different industries such as marketing, healthcare and finance, not only to explain actual behaviors, but also to predict
them and exploiting it for decisions making.

In In my last semester at University I had the opportunity to work in a challenging Data Science project which objective was to explain the reasons why automobile customers are loyal to a brand as
well as the reasons why they leave their current brands. The obtained results served as the basis for marketing campaign creation.

Since then, for me each dataset is an uncharted galaxy, waiting to be decoded so that it can contribute to the greater tapestry of knowledge.
